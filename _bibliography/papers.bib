Real-time implementation issues are discussed showing how the slow inference time associated with convolutional neural networks is addressed. The developed smartphone app is meant to act as a switch for noise reduction in the signal processing pipelines of hearing devices, enabling noise estimation or classification to be conducted in noise-only parts of noisy speech signals. The developed smartphone app is compared with a previously developed voice activity detection app as well as with two highly cited voice activity detection algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the developed app using convolutional neural network outperforms the previously developed smartphone app.},

  abstract={Real-time or applied digital signal processing courses are offered as follow-ups to conventional or theory-oriented digital signal processing courses in many engineering programs for the purpose of teaching students the technical know-how for putting signal processing algorithms or theory into practical use. These courses normally involve access to a teaching laboratory that is equipped with hardware boards, in particular DSP boards, together with their supporting software. A number of textbooks have been written discussing how to achieve real-time implementation on these hardware boards. This book discusses how to use smartphones as hardware boards for real-time implementation of signal processing algorithms, thus providing an alternative to the hardware boards that are used in signal processing laboratory courses.},

  abstract={Deep learning solutions are being increasingly used in mobile applications. Although there are many open-source software tools for the development of deep learning solutions, there are no guidelines in one place in a unified manner for using these tools toward real-time deployment of these solutions on smartphones. From the variety of available deep learning tools, the most suited ones are used in this paper to enable real-time deployment of deep learning inference networks on smartphones. A uniform flow of implementation is devised for both Android and iOS smartphones. The advantage of using multi-threading to achieve or improve real-time throughputs is also showcased. A benchmarking framework consisting of accuracy, CPU/GPU consumption, and real-time throughput is considered for validation purposes. The developed deployment approach allows deep learning models to be turned into real-time smartphone apps with ease based on publicly available deep learning and smartphone software tools. This approach is applied to six popular or representative convolutional neural network models, and the validation results based on the benchmarking metrics are reported.},

The real-time detection rates on smartphone platforms in realistic audio environments are reported. As an application of the developed app, it is used to act as an automatic switch between noise and speech sound signals in a noise adaptive speech enhancement pipeline. Objective measures are considered to examine enhanced speech for the switching done automatically and manually as the ground truth. The results obtained indicate that the automatic switching done by the real-time smartphone VAD app performs identical to the manual switching.}

This approach involves the use of an external dual-microphone and the processing steps needed to access audio signals from both of the external microphones at the same time. The developed approach is then applied to two example audio applications consisting of noise classification and noise reduction. It is shown that these dual-microphone apps lead to improved noise classification and noise reduction accuracy compared to the apps using a single microphone.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
